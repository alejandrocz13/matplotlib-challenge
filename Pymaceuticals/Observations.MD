## Observations

1. Capomulin and Ramicane are the very top 2 drugs to be used for further treatment and research according to all 3 variables analyzed. 
They are the top 2 in terms of Mice Survival (distinct 80% above), unlike the rest that perform at 56% at most. They show a spread of metastatic sites from 1.0 to 1.7(0.7 being the spread), unlike the rest that have a more spread of 1.0 (from 2.0 to 3.0). They are the only 2 drugs with a positive value for volume decrease in the tumor.

2. Capomulin, Ramicane, Naftisol, Zoniferol, and Ketapril are the only drugs that at some point in a 10-day interval can have a consistent survival of 10 days without a decrease until the chance of surviving decreases again. 

3. Zoniferol, Naftisol and Ceftamin are almost tied in 3rd place in terms of survival rate, where Zoniferol is slightly better than the other two drugs; however, Zoniferol spreads 1.0 more than Naftisol and Ceftamin. Ceftamin comes out as 3rd, after Capomulin and Ramicane and better than Zoniferol and Naftisol because in terms of Volume growth Ceftamin has 3rd place.
